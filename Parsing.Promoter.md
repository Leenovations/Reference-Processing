It downloads data from the UCSC Table Browser, specifically information about Chromosome, TSS (Transcription Start Site), Strand, and Gene Symbol. 
It then manipulates the data by defining the Promoter region with respect to the TSS, setting it at Â± 2000 base pairs for further analysis in the field of bioinformatics.
