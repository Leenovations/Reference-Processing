This code is intended to download exon and intron information for genes from NCBI RefSeq Selected references using the UCSC Table Browser.
It is designed to parse the reference data, specifically extracting the sequence order of exons and introns within the genes.
This parsing process is crucial for further analysis in the field of genomics and gene-related research.
